[{"id":1,"text":"After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."},{"id":2,"text":"Now in Jerusalem near the sheep-market there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Beth-zatha. It has five doorways."},{"id":3,"text":"In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases: some unable to see, some without the power of walking, some with wasted bodies{, waiting for the moving of the water."},{"id":4,"text":"For an angel went down at a certain time into the bath, and moved the water: the first one who went into the water after it was moved was made well of whatever disease he had}."},{"id":5,"text":"One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years."},{"id":6,"text":"When Jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition, and so he said to the man, Is it your desire to get well?"},{"id":7,"text":"The ill man said in answer, Sir, I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving; and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me."},{"id":8,"text":"Jesus said to him, Get up, take your bed and go."},{"id":9,"text":"And the man became well straight away, and took up his bed and went.
